	* Making version 0.10.1

	* configure.in: Added checks for libtcl8.0 and libtcl8.2, in
	addition to the library name specified by --with-tcl-lib-name
	option (which defaults to "tcl")

2000-02-29  Jasmin Patry  <jfpatry@cgl.uwaterloo.ca>

	* loop.c (main_loop): time steps are initialized when a new
	mode is entered; the size of the time step is now passed to the
	loop functions

	* course_render.c (render_course): Prompted by a patch from Michael
	Dale Long, fixed up lighting code to make dark areas of terrain
	less dark (now more reasonable for a snowfield).
	
	* tux.c (draw_tux): Cleaned up lighting code

	* racing.c (racing_loop): Fixed bug that was causing an unlimited
	number of particles to be generated (problem with centering of
	steering)
	
2000-02-28  Jasmin Patry  <jfpatry@cgl.uwaterloo.ca>

	* part_sys.c (create_new_particles): Now keep track of number of
	particles; abort if maximum number of particles exceeded (as this
	signals a bug)

2000-02-27  Jasmin Patry  <jfpatry@cgl.uwaterloo.ca>

	* Making version 0.10.
